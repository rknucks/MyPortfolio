                       A Graduate Student with valuable technical and IT support experience; recently earning a master’s
                            degree in Cybersecurity. I have gained knowledge in many areas of enterprise security, risk
                            management, infrastructure, vulnerabilities and controls. I am currently working on a Professional
                            Certificate for full-stack development at University of Arizona. My strengths include leading team projects, 
                            practiced speaker, excellent troubleshooting skills, polished communication skills, both verbal and written. 
                            I have the ability to grasp new concepts quickly. I was named to the "Wall of Fame" for outstanding 
                            troubleshooting skills at Nextel Communications.
                            <br>
                             I am an Integrity-driven, eager new professional 
                            excited to start a new career. I’m hoping to parlay my education and experience into a valued position 
                            with a successful company; to grow with and make a positive impact on that company, and the community. 
                            Whether that takes me into development, or into the enterprise security side, I want to make a valuable 
                            contribution; not only to my organization, but to the world.
                            <br>
                            Willing to relocate.
